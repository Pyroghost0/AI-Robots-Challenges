## About the Project
We have developed an interactive, hands-on, challenge-based learning software to educate students on cybersecurity principles. The web-based software emphasizes the importance of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and authentication (CIA), along with their practical implementation in real-world scenarios. Through these hands-on activities, non-major college students, high school teachers, and K-12 students will learn how to identify cyber threats and protect themselves against these threats by applying their newfound understanding of the CIA Triad, gaining a strong foundation in cybersecurity principles applicable to personal browsing and workplace environments, while empowering them to become informed and responsible digital citizens. Moreover, the software promotes adversarial thinking, problem-solving, and critical analysis skills among early learners and contributes to the progress of cybersecurity education and helps secure public awareness of cybersecurity issues while preparing the next generation of STEM scientists and engineers.

## Note For Future Developers
Take a look at our [git's wiki](https://github.com/CS-Capstone-P2/Main-FA22/wiki) for further information about the project.

## End-User Information
Check out our project hosted by Bradley University at: [cybered-capstone.bradley.edu](https://cybered-capstone.bradley.edu/).

For a walkthrough of our project check out our [Capstone User Guide](https://youtu.be/iXSMQxUcdM8).

If you want to download the code and host it yourself for viewing [below](https://github.com/CS-Capstone-P2/Main-FA22/blob/main/README.md#end-user-how-to-self-host) is the instructions on how to do so.

## End-User How-To Self Host
First, what you'll need to do is follow the instructions below to clone the Repository...
- Install [github desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (which I recommend for new users). 
- Either sign in with an existing github account or skip the sign-in step by supplying a username and email.
- Hit "Clone a repository from the Internet..." then Click the URL button
- Paste `https://github.com/CS-Capstone-P2/Main-FA22` into the URL Bar
- Then choose the file location that you would like to have the repo cloned to (Have a specific folder for it.)

Then Once you have the Repository cloned, you need to open it in Visual Studio Code with Live Server...
- Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on your computer.
- Now we need to install the extension [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
- Make sure to select your browser of Choice upon installing Live Server.

Now that we have the repo cloned, visual studio code (VS code) installed, all that is left is to open the project in VS Code...
- Under the File tab in VS Code click `Open Folder` or use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+K Ctrl+O`
- Navigate to the folder which we cloned our repo to. By Default it is `%UserProfile%/Documents/GitHub/Main-FA22`
- Select `Main-FA22` folder in the GitHub Folder then click `open`
- Once the project has opened, you can view in the development environment. Do so by going to the bottom right hand corner then hitting the `Go Live` button.
